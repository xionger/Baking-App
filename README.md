# Baking-App

This App is created as a part of [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). The app is proposed to allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief to share her recipes with the world. I built this app from scratch. 

## What I Learned

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to the app.
* Leverage a third-party library in the app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
* MVP architecture.
